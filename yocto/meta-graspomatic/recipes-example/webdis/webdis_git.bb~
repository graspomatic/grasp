# WARNING: the following LICENSE and LIC_FILES_CHKSUM values are best guesses - it is
# your responsibility to verify that the values are complete and correct.
#
# The following license files were not able to be identified and are
# represented as "Unknown" below, you will need to check them yourself:
#   COPYING
#   hiredis/COPYING
#
# NOTE: multiple licenses have been detected; they have been separated with &
# in the LICENSE value for now since it is a reasonable assumption that all
# of the licenses apply. If instead there is a choice between the multiple
# licenses then you should change the value to separate the licenses with |
# instead of &. If there is any doubt, check the accompanying documentation
# to determine which situation is applicable.
